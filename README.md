When creating the task definition, these were the specific configurations needed


Task role 
- selected ECStaskExecutionRole

Task size
- Task memory (GB) 4GB
- Task CPU (vCPU) 1vCPU

Container definitions
- Click on add a container

In image box get from repository the repository-url/image:tag (should look something like this public.ecr.aws/--------/jenkins:latest , found in ECR)

Port mappings
- 8080 tcp

After task definition is created use the Public ip and attach it to :8080 to get into jenkins.

The password is needed to access jenkins, it will be in the logs of the cluster.

# Jenkins

- Docker pipeline plugin

- AWS EC2 plugin

Configure Jenkins agent, then a Multibranch Pipeline. After assigning label remember to add to label to jenkinsfile on github.

# Ubuntu

In ubuntu vm instance
```
-curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"

-sudo apt-get install unzip

-sudo apt update

-sudo apt install default-jdk

-sudo ./aws/install

-sudo apt-get unzip awscliv2.zip

-unzip awscliv2.zip

-aws configure

-pwd

```


```
-sudo apt update


-sudo apt install software-properties-common ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent apt-transport-https


-curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

-sudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \$(lsb_release -cs) \stable"

-sudo apt update

-sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

```

# Github
 
* Within the folder that contains the snapshot
- Drag file to GitHub demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
* After assigning label given to agent in jenkins, add it to jenkinsfile on github
Within Jenkinsfile add commands 

```
"docker build -t javaapp ."
"docker tag javaapp:latest 32322323/javaapp"
sh "docker push 32322323/javaapp:latest" ```
  
 These commands allow for the Build to run successfully as well as the image to be pushed to DockerHub
